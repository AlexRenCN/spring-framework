/**
 * 异常增强
 * Tag interface for throws advice.
 *
 * <p>There are not any methods on this interface, as methods are invoked by
 * reflection. Implementing classes must implement methods of the form:
 *
 * <pre class="code">void afterThrowing([Method, args, target], ThrowableSubclass);</pre>
 *
 * <p>Some examples of valid methods would be:
 *
 * <pre class="code">public void afterThrowing(Exception ex)</pre>
 * <pre class="code">public void afterThrowing(RemoteException)</pre>
 * <pre class="code">public void afterThrowing(Method method, Object[] args, Object target, Exception ex)</pre>
 * <pre class="code">public void afterThrowing(Method method, Object[] args, Object target, ServletException ex)</pre>
 *
 * The first three arguments are optional, and only useful if we want further
 * information about the joinpoint, as in AspectJ <b>after-throwing</b> advice.
 *
 * 如果异常通知方法抛出异常本身，它将重写原始异常（即更改抛出给用户的异常）。
 * 重写异常通常是运行时异常；它与任何方法签名都兼容。但是，如果异常通知方法抛出checked异常，
 * 则它必须与目标方法的声明异常匹配，因此在某种程度上耦合到特定的目标方法签名。
 * <b>不要抛出与目标方法的签名不兼容的未声明的checked异常！
 * <p><b>Note:</b> If a throws-advice method throws an exception itself, it will
 * override the original exception (i.e. change the exception thrown to the user).
 * The overriding exception will typically be a RuntimeException; this is compatible
 * with any method signature. However, if a throws-advice method throws a checked
 * exception, it will have to match the declared exceptions of the target method
 * and is hence to some degree coupled to specific target method signatures.
 * <b>Do not throw an undeclared checked exception that is incompatible with
 * the target method's signature!</b>
